<p>I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.stavvy.com">Stavvy</a> with practical experience developing backend systems and web applications. My stack includes AWS, FastAPI, Python, Postgres, TypeScript, React, and Tailwind. </p>

<p>I have enjoyed a varied career, spanning environments from an organic farm to a tiny start-up to a Fortune 500 bank to an open-source civic journalism project. </p>
