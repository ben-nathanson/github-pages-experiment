### How did you get here?

I am the type of person who gets the same satisfaction from building IKEA furniture as they once did building LEGO kits. If I had to define myself simply, I would say that I like building things and fixing stuff. Always have. Software engineering happens to be a fantastic way to get paid to do that! This took me some time to figure out, however. I probably wrote my first line of (horrible, no good, very bad) Java code around age 22.

Before earning a degree in computer science from the University of Pittsburgh and launching myself into a software career, I studied sustainability and political science at Dickinson College. That led to working on an organic farm, serving as a sustainability fellow with the Student Conservation Association, and later joining Construction Junction in their mission to keep building materials out of landfills. In my senior year, I used geospatial analysis tools for problems like predicting wildfires, calculating the best spot in town to start a new bar, and using zoning data to illustrate the transformation of farmland into warehouses in Pennsylvania. This was the lightbulb that first drew my attention to software as a tool that could "build things and fix stuff".

After completing my first degree, I starting teaching myself Java via [CodingBat](https://codingbat.com/java), read John MacCormick's book on [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9_Algorithms_That_Changed_the_Future), watched *The Imitation Game*, and generally geeked out about the potential of applying computer science to conservation. Eventually this hobby would turn into a career path and I began C.S. night classes at Pitt, partially on a scholarship awarded by AmeriCorps for my work in the Student Conservation Association. After a year or so of this, I got tired of trying to stay awake for my algorithms lectures at 8 p.m. and decided to quit my job to pursue classes during the daytime. Someday I'll write a blog post about choosing between a second bachelor's / master's / code bootcamp, but the short version is that it came to down to wanting a solid computer science foundation, in a reasonable amount of time, and as someone without a solid academic background in the sciences.

As a capstone to my education, I worked at PNC numo as an intern and contractor developing backend distributed systems, deploying a test pipeline for a backend API, and building a test framework for indi, a mobile banking app. I'm excited to see the product take off and it was a privilege to work with everyone there.

### Where are you now?

Boston. Brookline, more specifically. I landed a great job at [Stavvy](https://www.stavvy.com) as a full-stack Software Engineer where I am working on Python, AWS, TypeScript, and more. 

### What do you do besides work?

I really do love coding. It's a hobby that turned into a job. But when I'm not coding, I compose and perform music with various bands (guitar / bass / synthesizer), research the Pittsburgh taco scene, and enjoy endurance running along the South Side trail and Emerald View Park.

### Tabs or spaces?
Tabs.
