### Ongoing Projects

- **This Website**
  - [nathanson.dev](https://nathanson.dev)
  - [Source code](https://github.com/ben-nathanson/ben-nathanson.github.io)
  - This website's stack consists of:
     1. [Beautiful Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) on the front end. 
     1. Google Domains as the registrar for `nathanson.dev`. 
     1. GitHub Pages for hosting.
  - I chose this tech stack because it allowed me to deliver something quickly, it's easy to maintain, is well documented, and I love writing in markdown. 


- **Pittsburgh Strings**
  - [pittsburghstrings.com](https://pittsburghstrings.com)
  - [Source code](https://github.com/ben-nathanson/jake-nathanson-music.github.io)
  - This is an online portfolio for my brother, a professional cellist and pianist. 
  - The tech stack includes Beautiful Jekyll and Github pages. I chose this stack because I was already familiar with it from building my personal website. It also offerered more flexibility and affordability compared to other options we considered, such as Wordpress. 
  - We worked together to define use cases, draft the site structure, and iterated until we knew it would be effective at attracting new clients. 
  
### Previous Projects

- **City Scrapers**
  - [City Scrapers Events](https://pgh-public-meetings.github.io/events/)
  - [Source code](https://github.com/pgh-public-meetings/city-scrapers-pitt)
  - We used web scrapers to construct database of meetings for use by journalists, activists, and the community.
  - My role focused on maintaining the repo, mentoring new contributors, and improving the developer experience from tooling to documentation.
  - Thanks to [Code & Supply](https://codeandsupply.co/) for offering us space to host meetings!
